We design an attention-augmented Fully Convolutional Network (FCN-CBAM) for downhole microseismic event localization.

'fcn_train.py':  FCN-based localization network. Input: waveform data of size 12×512×3. Output: 144×3×1. 'sgydata.py' is used for data processing, and 'Attention64.py' / 'Attention128.py' define the attention modules. The train1 folder contains 2,000 training samples (size 12×512×3). The traning data demo (2000 samples,163MB) are accessible on the zenodo via https://zenodo.org/records/17831703 'train1_new.txt' provides the corresponding downhole hypocenter locations.
